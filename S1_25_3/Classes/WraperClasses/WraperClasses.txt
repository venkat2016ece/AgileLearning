Primitive data types will be 8 types
1.byte 
2.short
3.int
4.long
5.float
6.double
7.character
8.boolean

And this 8 primitive data types must be binded in to the objects.

==>whenever you want to bind the primitive datatype into object we take the support of special classes avilable from java.lang package.


==>the process of binding primitive data type into wrapper classes object we are calling it as "Boxing process"

==>the process of taking primitive datatypes outof wrapper class object we are calling it as a "UN BOXING PROCESS"


==>so whennever you want to pperform the boxing and unboxing process you must follow the hirarchy of the class.
